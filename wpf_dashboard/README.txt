This module serves a few different purposes.

1) It sets up a number of blocks for use in a user dashboard

2) It creates "ticket" pages (two different types) that take information from Ubercart orders and presents it in a format suitable for printing.  Data on these pages are given in form fields, and may be edited and saved to a database table, so the changes do not alter the order.  This allows last minute changes to the order tickets.

3) Creates a custom order invoice suitable for printing.
